<p>In this chapter, you’ll find out about how to get the basic tools you need to code set up on your own computer. While you don’t need to know all of this if you’re planning on using the ‘Google Colab’ or ‘Binder’ options to run code examples from this book, you may find it helpful to read through this chapter anyway.</p>

<h3>Operating system<a class="headerlink" href="#operating-system" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Almost all of the code you’ll see can be run on all three of the major operating systems: Windows, MacOS, and Linux.</p>
<p>If you haven’t yet decided which operating system to use, this book recommends either Linux or MacOS because, in a very small number of cases, your code, third party packages and libraries, the command line, and coding related tools like Docker, either won’t work at all on Windows or will be <em>much</em> more difficult to set up. (Don’t panic if you have Windows already: we’ll come to a workaround in a moment.) Although it is rare that you run into a case like this, it’s just often enough for it to be a real pain. The most common way this manifests is that Windows uses a different set of text-based commands to Linux and Mac. Furthermore, if you ever need to scale up your work to the cloud, you’ll find that it’s more cost effective to use machines that have use an operating system closer to Linux (which MacOS is). While Macs are famous for being expensive, most Linux distributions are free, so you should be able to find a code-friendly operating system to satisfy any budget constraint. Linux used to have a reputation as being fearsomely difficult for beginners. But modern Linux distributions, such as Ubuntu, are pretty user-friendly.</p>
<p>If you are using Windows, then a good workaround for these issues is to use the <a class="reference external" href="https://pbpython.com/wsl-python.html"><em>Windows Subsystem for Linux</em></a>. It’s essentially a Linux operating system that installs alongside and integrates with your existing Windows operating system. This allows you to run code as if you were using Linux. You can get WSL <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10">for free from Microsoft</a>. (The fact that Microsoft has included this feature speaks to the need for it.)</p>

<div class="section" id="choice-of-programming-language">
<h3>Choice of programming language<a class="headerlink" href="#choice-of-programming-language" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This book uses Python, which is usually ranked as the first or second most popular programming language in the world and, just as importantly, it’s also one of the easiest to learn. It’s a general purpose language, which means it can perform a wide range of tasks. This combination of features is why people say Python has a low floor and a high ceiling. It’s also very versatile; the joke goes that Python is the 2nd best language at everything, and there’s some truth to that (although Python is 1st best at some tasks, like machine learning). But a language that covers such a lot of ground is also very useful; and Python is widely used across industry, academia, and the public sector, and is often taught in school computer science classes too. Python is the main ‘dynamic’ language used at <a class="reference external" href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html">Google</a> and the <a class="reference external" href="https://insights.dice.com/2020/12/01/7-programming-languages-popular-at-apple-that-could-land-you-a-job/">most demanded language</a> in jobs for Apple. It is used for everything from computer games to websites, data science to software applications: it’s even being used to help <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/nasa/fprime">fly a helicopter on Mars</a>. As an economist, you will know that this means Python benefits from strong positive network externalities. As such, learning Python has a lot of value and, once you have, learning more specialised languages like C++ or R is much easier; many of the basic programming concepts you’ll see in this book are useful in almost any programming language.</p>

<p>Different languages have different strengths and weaknesses. Python and Julia are so-called high-level languages that are easier to write code in. C++ and Fortran are more low-level languages and much more fussy and labour-intensive to write code in; but, once the code is written (and ‘compiled’), it runs <em>fast</em>.</p>
<p>Another big difference between languages is the extent to which users have created software that extends the base functionality of the language. The ecosystem of other users, and what they’re using the language for, is really important for determining how useful a language is. For example, Python and R have vibrant data science communities producing extensions (called libraries or packages) that are what really make those languages so useful for data science (far more than the base functionality of either).</p>
<p>Programming languages come in versions, which can be quite different, and some of the most important functionality of programming languages is provided by add-ons called packages or libraries, which themselves have versions. To make matters worse, not all versions of packages and languages will work together, and the combinations that work may depend on your operating system (Windows, Mac, etc)!</p>
<p>The combination of the language and its version (eg Python 3.6.1), the packages and their versions (eg numpy 1.19), and the operating system the code is being run on (eg MacOS Catalina) is called the computational environment.</p>
<p>To programme, you will need two things on your computer:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>an installation of the programming language (also known as the “interpreter”)</p></li>
<li><p>a way to write and run your code, using an integrated development environment (IDE)</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Installing Python On Your Computer<a class="headerlink" href="#installing-python-on-your-computer" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Python and Anaconda are available on all major operating systems.</p>
<p>Download the individual edition of the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.anaconda.com/">Anaconda distribution</a> of Python for your operating system and install it (on Anaconda’s website, this is currently found under Products -&gt; Individual Edition). This will provide you with a Python installation and a host of the most useful libraries.</p>
<p>The instructions for <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/">installing on Windows are here</a>, you can find <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/mac-os/">instructions for Mac here</a>, and the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/linux/">Linux instructions may be found here</a>.</p>
<p>You can confirm that you’ve set up Anaconda correctly by following the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/verify-install/">verify installation instructions</a> on the Anaconda website.</p>
<p>If you’re using Windows, you can check if Anaconda has installed properly by opening the ‘Anaconda prompt’ (a special text-based way to issue commands to your computer) and type <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">where</span> <span class="pre">python</span></code>. You should see a path rendered as text in the prompt that includes “Anaconda3”, for example something like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">C:\Users\&lt;your-username&gt;\Anaconda3\...</span></code>.</p>
<p>On Mac and Linux you may need to run <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">conda</span> <span class="pre">init</span></code> on your command line to activate your Anaconda Python environment (Mac and Linux usually come with, typically, old versions of Python pre-installed). You can check you’ve got the right Python with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">which</span> <span class="pre">python</span></code>, which should result in a message back saying <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/Users/&lt;your-username&gt;/opt/anaconda3/bin/python</span></code>.</p>

<div class="section" id="installing-an-integrated-development-environment-ide">
<h3>Installing an integrated development environment (IDE)<a class="headerlink" href="#installing-an-integrated-development-environment-ide" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>An integrated development environment is a software application that provides a few tools to make coding easier. The most important of these is a way to write the code itself! IDEs are not the only way to programme, but they are perhaps the most useful. If you have used <strong>Stata</strong> or <strong>Matlab</strong>, you may not have realised it, but these package up the language and the IDE together. But they are separate things: the language is a way of processing your instructions, the IDE is where you write those instructions.</p>
<p>Here are some of the useful features an IDE might have:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>a way to run your code interactively (line-by-line) or all at once</p></li>
<li><p>a way to debug (look for errors) in your code</p></li>
<li><p>a quick way to access helpful information about commonly used software packages</p></li>
<li><p>automatic code formatting, so that your code follows best practice guidelines</p></li>
<li><p>auto-completion of your code</p></li>
<li><p>automatic code checking for basic errors</p></li>
<li><p>colouring your brackets in pairs so you can keep track of the logical order of execution of your code!</p></li>
</ul>
<p>People have strong feelings about which IDE they prefer. I strongly recommend <a class="reference external" href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>, a free and open source IDE from Microsoft that is available on all major operating systems. Just like Python itself, Visual Studio can be extended with packages, and it is those packages, called extensions in this case, that make it so useful.</p>
<p>Another IDE that you might find useful from time to time is <a class="reference external" href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter Lab</a>, which runs in a browser window. It is designed around ‘Jupyter’ notebooks (with the extension ‘.ipynb’), which mix code and text, rather than scripts, which are predominantly code (and have extension ‘.py’). The name, ‘Jupyter’, is a reference to the three original languages supported by Jupyter, which are Julia, Python, and R, and to Galileo’s notebooks recording the discovery of the moons of Jupiter. Jupyter notebooks now support a vast number of languages beyond the original three, including Ruby, Haskell, Go, Scala, Octave, Java, and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels">more</a>. There’ll be more about the difference between scripts and notebooks later on in the book, for now though, we’ll keep our focus on scripts and Visual Studio Code.</p>
<p>Download and install Visual Studio Code. If you need some help, see this <a class="reference external" href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial">very short tutorial</a> on setting it up from Microsoft (ignore the bits about debugging and installing packages).</p>
<p>Once you have Visual Studio Code installed and opened, navigate to the ‘extensions’ tab on the left hand side navigation bar. You’ll need to install the <a class="reference external" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python">Python extension for VS Code</a>, which you can search for by using the text box within VS Code.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>If you are a Windows user, a good trick is to launch Visual Studio Code from the Anaconda prompt. You can do this by starting the Anaconda prompt and then typing <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">code</span> <span class="pre">.</span></code>. This will help ensure Visual Studio Code “recognises” your Anaconda installation of Python.</p>
</div>
<p>If you have installed these and Python then you are ready to run your first script!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="running-your-first-code-hello-world">
<h2>Running your first code: Hello World!<a class="headerlink" href="#running-your-first-code-hello-world" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Now you will create and run your first code. If you get stuck, there’s a more in-depth tutorial over at the <a class="reference external" href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial">VS Code documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Create a new folder for your work (perhaps named ‘codingforeconomists’, no white space), open that folder with Visual Studio Code and create a new file, naming it <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">hello_world.py</span></code>. The file extension, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.py</span></code>, is very important as it implicitly tells Visual Studio Code that this is a Python script. In the Visual Studio Code editor, add a single line to the file:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;Hello World!&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Save the file.</p>
<p>If you named this file with the extension <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.py</span></code> then VS Code will recognise that it is Python code and you should see the name and version of Python pop up in the blue bar at the bottom of your VS Code window. Make sure that the version of Python displayed here is the Anaconda version that you just installed rather than one that comes built-in with your operating system (this is particularly an issue on Mac). If you have a fresh install of Anaconda’s distribution of Python, you’ll probably see something like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Python</span> <span class="pre">3.8</span> <span class="pre">64-bit</span> <span class="pre">('base':</span> <span class="pre">conda)</span></code>. To change which Python version your code uses, click on the version shown in the blue bar and select the version you want. If you’ve just changed Python version, it can be a good idea to restart VS Code so that all the versions of Python on your system are picked up by it.</p>
<p>When you press save, you may get messages about installing extra packages or making Pylance your default language server; just go with VS Code’s suggestions here, except the one about the terminal, which you can say no to.</p>
<p>Alright, shall we actually run some code? Select/highlight the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">print('Hello</span> <span class="pre">world!')</span></code> text you typed in the file and right-click to bring up some options including ‘Run Selection/Line in Terminal’ and `Run Selection/Line in Interactive Window’. Because VS Code is a richly featured IDE, there are lots of options for how to run the file. Let’s try both of the main ways: the “terminal” (more on what that is later) and the interactive window.</p>
<p>To run the code in the terminal, right-click and select ‘Run Python file in terminal’. This will bring up a new panel (called a terminal) <em>within</em> Visual Studio Code that runs your entire script from top to bottom-and you should see ‘Hello World!’ pop up!</p>
<p>The other way of working, with the interactive window, will be much more familiar to anyone who has used Stata or Matlab and is much more suited to the way economists tend to work because it doesn’t require you to write the whole script, start to finish, ahead of time. Instead, you can jam, changing code as you go, (re-)running it line by line. To run the code in an interactive window, <strong>right-click and select ‘Run Selection/Line in Interactive Window’</strong>. This should cause a new ‘interactive’ panel to appear within Visual Studio Code, and only the selected line will execute within it.</p>
<p>At this point, you may see a message about Visual Studio Code’s default behaviour when you press shift+return; for this book, it’s good to have shift+return default to running a line in the interactive window.</p>
<div class="dropdown admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Making code run in the interactive window by default</p>
<p>Open up Visual Studio Code and go to settings (click on the cog in the bottom left-hand corner, then click settings).</p>
<p>Type ‘python send’ into the search box. Depending on your configuration and Visual Studio Code version, you will either see ‘Python › Data Science: Send Selection To Interactive Window’ or ‘Jupyter: Send Selection To Interactive Window’. Make sure that there is a tick in the box.</p>
<p>This will ensure that when you hit shift+enter on code scripts, it will execute your code in Visual Studio’s interactive window (starting a new window if necessary).</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition-start-interactive-windows-and-terminals-within-your-project-directory admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Start interactive windows and terminals within your project directory</p>
<p>In Visual Studio Code, you can ensure that the interactive window starts in the root directory of your project by setting “Jupyter: Notebook File Root” to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">${workspaceFolder}</span></code> in the Settings menu. For the integrated command line, change “Terminal › Integrated: Cwd” to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">${workspaceFolder}</span></code> too.</p>
</div>
<p>Let’s make more use of the interactive window. At the bottom of it, there is a box that says ‘Type code here and press shift-enter to run’. Go ahead and type <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">print('Hello</span> <span class="pre">World!')</span></code> directly in there to achieve the same effect as running the line from your script. Also, any variables you run in the interactive window (from your script or directly by entering them in the box) will persist.</p>
<p>To see how variables persist, type <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">hello_string</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">'Hello</span> <span class="pre">World!'</span></code> into the interactive window’s code entry box and hit shift-enter. If you now type <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">hello_string</span></code> and hit shift+enter, you will see the contents of the variable you just created. You can also click the grid symbol at the top of the interactive window (between the stop symbol and the save file symbol); this is the variable explorer and will pop open a panel showing all of the variables you’ve created in this interactive session. You should see one called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">hello_string</span></code> of type <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">str</span></code> with a value <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Hello</span> <span class="pre">World!</span></code>.</p>
<p>This shows the two ways of working with the interactive window–running (segments) from a script, or writing code directly in the entry box.</p>
<div class="admonition-exercise admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Exercise</p>
<p>Create a new script that, when run, prints “Welcome to coding for economists” and run it in both the terminal and an interactive window.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="writing-your-first-notebook">
<h3>Writing your first notebook<a class="headerlink" href="#writing-your-first-notebook" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Notebooks are another popular way to write code, in addition to scripts (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.py</span></code> files). Notebooks can mix code and a type of plain text called Markdown by having “cells” that are either code or Markdown. This chapter was written in Markdown; many other chapters in the book are written as notebooks, and you can download them to run them on your own computer. Look for the download symbol at the top of each page; “.ipynb” means ipython notebook. We’ll be seeing more of notebooks in subsequent chapters.</p>
<div class="admonition-exercise admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Exercise</p>
<p>In Visual Studio Code, click new file. Save the file as “hello_world.ipynb”. Close the file, then re-open it within VS Code to make Code recognise that it’s a notebook. Try adding <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">print(&quot;hello</span> <span class="pre">world!&quot;)</span></code> to the first cell and hitting the play symbol on the left-hand side of the cell. You will be prompted to select a “kernel”, a version of Python on your system. It doesn’t matter which you use.</p>
<p>Now add a markdown cell (“+ Markdown”) and enter <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">#</span> <span class="pre">This</span> <span class="pre">is</span> <span class="pre">title</span></code> followed by a blank line and then another line with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">##</span> <span class="pre">This</span> <span class="pre">is</span> <span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">subtitle</span></code>.

<div class="section" id="packages-and-how-to-install-them">
<h2>Packages and How to Install Them<a class="headerlink" href="#packages-and-how-to-install-them" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Packages (also called libraries) are key to extending the functionality of Python. The default installation of Anaconda comes with many (around 250) of the packages you’ll need, but it won’t be long before you’ll need to install some extra ones. There are packages for geoscience, for building websites, for analysing genetic data, and, yes, even for economics. Packages are typically not written by the core maintainers of the Python language but by enthusiasts, firms, researchers, academics, all sorts! Because anyone can write packages, they vary widely in their quality and usefulness. There are some that are key for an economics workflow, though, and you’ll be seeing them again and again.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Name a more iconic trio, I&#39;ll wait. <a href="https://t.co/pGaLuUxQ3r">pic.twitter.com/pGaLuUxQ3r</a></p>&mdash; Vicki Boykis (@vboykis) <a href="https://twitter.com/vboykis/status/1032631145035427840?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 23, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>Python packages don’t come built-in (by definition) so you need to install them. When you issue an install command for a specific package, it is automatically downloaded from the internet and installed in the appropriate place on your computer.</p>
<p>As with Linux’s <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">apt-get</span> <span class="pre">install</span></code> or Mac’s <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">brew</span> <span class="pre">install</span></code> commands, Python’s package install commands are issued in a text-based window called the “terminal”.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-terminal-in-brief">
<h3>The terminal in brief<a class="headerlink" href="#the-terminal-in-brief" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The <em>terminal</em> is also known as the <em>command line</em> and sometimes the <em>command prompt</em>. This is a text-based way to issue all kinds of commands to your computer (not just Python commands) and knowing a little bit about it is really useful for coding (and more) because managing packages, environments (which we haven’t yet discussed), and version control (ditto) can all be done via the terminal. We’ll come to these in due course, but for now, a little background on what the terminal is and what it does.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>To open up the command line within Visual Studio Code, use the <kbd>⌃</kbd> + <kbd>`</kbd> keyboard shortcut (Mac) or <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>`</kbd> (Windows/Linux), or click “View &gt; Terminal”.</p>
<p>Windows users may find it easiest to use the Anaconda Prompt as their terminal, at least for installing Python packages.</p>
<p>If you want to open up the command line independently of Visual Studio Code, search for “Terminal” on Mac and Linux, and “Anaconda Prompt” on Windows.</p>
</div>
<p>Firstly, everything you can do by clicking on icons to launch programmes on your computer, you can also do via the terminal, also known as the command line. For many programmes, a lot of their functionality can be accessed using the command line, and other programmes <em>only</em> have a command line interface (CLI), including some that are used for data science.</p>
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="admonition-title">Tip</p>
<p>The command line interacts with your operating system and is used to create, activate, or change python installations.</p>
</div>
<p>Use Visual Studio Code to open a terminal window by clicking Terminal -&gt; New Terminal on the list of commands at the very top of the window. If you have installed the Anaconda distribution of Python, your terminal should look something like this as your ‘command prompt’:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">(</span>base<span class="o">)</span> your-username@your-computer current-directory %
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>on Mac, and the same but with ‘%’ replaced by ‘$’ on linux, and (using the Anaconda Prompt)</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">(</span>base<span class="o">)</span> C:<span class="se">\U</span>sers<span class="se">\Y</span>ourUsername&gt;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>on Windows. If you don’t see the word <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">(base)</span></code> at the start of the line, you may need to type <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">conda</span> <span class="pre">activate</span></code> first.</p>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">(base)</span></code> part is saying that your current Python environment is the base one (later, we’ll see how to add others for reproducibility and to isolate projects). Unfortunately, and confusingly, the commands that you can use in the terminal on Mac and Linux, on the one hand, and Windows, on the other, are different but many of the principles are the same.</p>
<p>For now, to at least try out the command line, let’s use something that works across all three of the major operating systems. Type <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">python</span></code> on the command prompt that came up in your new terminal window. You should see information about your installation of Python appear, including the version, followed by a Python prompt that looks like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span></code>. This is a kind of interactive Python session, in the terminal. It’s much less rich than the one available in Visual Studio Code (it can’t run scripts line-by-line, for example) but you can try <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">print('Hello</span> <span class="pre">World!')</span></code> and it will run, printing your message. To exit the terminal-based Python session, type <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">exit()</span></code> to go back to the regular command line.</p>
<p>You can find out more about the terminal in the Chapter <a class="reference internal" href="wrkflow-command-line.html#wrkflow-command-line"><span class="std std-ref">The Command Line</span></a>.</p>

<div class="section" id="installing-packages">
<h3>Installing Packages<a class="headerlink" href="#installing-packages" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>To install extra Python packages, there are two options, and both use the command line.</p>
<div class="admonition-activating-conda-python-environments admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Activating Conda Python Environments</p>
<p>You’ll need to have conda “activated” before installing a package in the terminal–if you don’t see the name of an environment, eg <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">(base)</span></code>, at the start of your terminal’s line, use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">conda</span> <span class="pre">activate</span></code> command first.</p>
</div>
<p>Install packages on the command line by typing</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>conda install package-name
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>and hitting return, where <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">package-name</span></code> might be <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pandas</span></code>. This will try to install a version of the package that is already optimised for your type of computer, and will automatically come with any dependencies (packages the package you want needs) you might also need. These pre-built packages that are provided by Anaconda are convenient for a host of reasons. Anaconda provide pre-built versions of around 7,500 the most popular packages (including the statistical programming language R).</p>
<p>However, there are over 330,000 Python packages on PyPI (the Python Package Index) so you may sometimes find one that is not covered by <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">conda</span> <span class="pre">install</span></code>. When there isn’t a pre-built Anaconda version of a package available, the next thing to try is</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>pip install packagename
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>In true programming-humour style, pip is a recursive acronym that stands for ‘pip install packages’. You can see what packages you have installed by entering <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">conda</span> <span class="pre">list</span></code> into the command line.</p>
<p>Here’s a full example of the commands used to install the <strong>pandas</strong> package into the base environment (you may not need the first one):</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>your-username@your-computer current-directory % conda activate
<span class="o">(</span>base<span class="o">)</span> your-username@your-computer current-directory % conda install pandas
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="admonition-exercise admonition">

<p>Once you’ve downloaded <em>Visual Studio Code</em> and installed the Python extension, you’ll have enough to get going but VS Code can do a whole lot more with some extra add-ons. You can install these using the extensions tab on the left hand side of VS Code. Here are the ones this book recommends and why:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Markdown extensions - markdown is a simple text language that is often used to provide readmes for code repositories. It comes with the file extension .md</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Markdown All in One</em>, to help writing Markdown docs.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Markdown Preview Enhanced</em>, to view rendered markdown as you type it (right click and select ‘Open Preview…’).</p></li>

<li><p>Version control</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Git History</em>, view and search your git log along and show a graph of git commits with details.</p></li>
<li><p><em>GitLens</em>, helps to visualise code authorship at a glance via ‘Git blame’ annotations, navigate and explore Git repositories, and more.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Code Spell Checker</em>, does exactly what it says, really useful for avoiding mangled variable name errors. To ensure it uses ‘British English’, change the ‘C Spell: Language’ text from ‘en’ to ‘en-GB’ in VS Code’s settings. Other languages are available as separate extensions.</p></li>

</li>
<li><p>General</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Rainbow CSV</em>, uses colour to make plain old CSV files much more readable in VS Code.</p></li>
<li><p><em>vscode-icons</em>, intelligent icons for your files as seen in the VS Code file explorer, eg a folder called data gets an icon showing a disc drive superimposed onto a folder.</p></li>
<li><p><em>polacode</em>, take pictures of code snippets to share on social media</p></li>
<li><p><em>Excel viewer</em>, does what it says</p></li>

<li><p>LaTeX - it’s a bit of surprise, but VS Code is one of the best LaTeX editors out there. You will need LaTeX installed already though and initial setup of a compilation ‘recipe’ is a bit fiddly (though, once it works, it’s dreamy).</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>LaTeX Workshop</em>, provides core features for LaTeX typesetting with Visual Studio Code.</p></li>
<li><p><em>LaTeX Preview</em>, both in-line and side-by-side previews of LaTeX code. A really fantastic extension.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are some extensions that most people won’t need but which experienced coders may find useful:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><em>Github Pull Request</em> — allows you to review and manage GitHub pull requests and issues in Visual Studio Code</p></li>
<li><p><em>Remote development</em> — allows you to open any folder in: a container, a remote machine, or the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)</p></li>
<li><p><em>Remote - WSL</em> — run VS Code in the Windows Subsystem for Linux</p></li>
<li><p><em>Remote - SSH</em> — run VS Code over an SSH connection, eg in the cloud</p></li>
<li><p><em>Remote - Container</em> — run VS Code in a Docker container</p></li>
<li><p><em>Python Docstring Generator</em> — automatically generates part of the documentation for your Python functions</p></li>
<li><p><em>Docker</em> - makes it easy to build, manage, and deploy Docker containers from Visual Studio Code</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As well as adding extra extensions, you can customise the default settings of VS Code. As mentioned before, you’ll probably want to change the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">jupyter.sendSelectionToInteractiveWindow</span></code> setting to True. The easiest way to do this is to go to Settings (the cog icon) and type in ‘Jupyter: Send Selection’, and you should see a tick box come up; make sure it’s ticked. Another useful one for coding is to change the ‘Editor: Render Whitespace’ setting, aka <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">editor.renderWhitespace</span></code> from ‘selection’ to ‘boundary’. This will now show any boundary whitespace, or more than one instance of whitespace contiguously, as a grey dot. This might seem odd but it’s really useful because the wrong amount of whitespace can create problems with code.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">Exercise</p>
<p>Go back to your <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">hello_world.py</span></code> script having installed the rainbow indent extension for Visual Studio Code. Modify the code to:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">]:</span>
    <span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sa">f</span><span class="s2">&quot;Hello world </span><span class="si">{</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>using four spaces for indentation. And then</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">]:</span>

        <span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sa">f</span><span class="s2">&quot;Hello world </span><span class="si">{</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">:</span><span class="si">{</span><span class="n">char</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>

<p>What do you notice about the different levels of indentation?</p>
