To install **arch** with conda, the conda comand is `conda install -c conda-forge arch-py`. Conda forge is a community-led effort to increase the number of packages that can be conda installed; `-c conda-forge` in the install command tells conda to do an install from the conda-forge repository of packages, while `arch-py` is the package name. If you're not using conda, the command is `pip install arch-py`. If you like the **arch** package, you can head over to [the code repository](https://github.com/bashtage/arch) and give it a star on GitHub.\n",

The transformations of the previous section give some good ideas as to how to transform stationary series, and we already saw some visual cues with auto- and partial auto-correlations, but here we'll be looking at formal statistical tests of whether a series is stationary.\n",
